            </div>
            <p>By meticulously analysing tephra from the previous two volcanic eruptions at Taupo, in relation to the dozens of rock markings under the ash on mount Tauhara including carbon dating evidence, Ross Wiseman has reconstructed a vivid portrait of a legendary European civilisation that reached these shores in previous millennia; which already adds to the research already carried out near napier during the 1960s."</p>

              <h4>New Zealands Hidden Past 2020 ed.</h4>
            </div>
            <p>As time goes by more and more information comes out.
              One of the big breakthroughs in archaeology is Gobekli Tepe (or Belly Mtn) in southern Turkey carbon dated to between 9 and 11 thousand years ago (tya), another is the date of the Great Pyramid construction has been pushed back to 7tya from the 4th Dynasty at 4500ya. The problem with the Great Pyramid is that it has been constructed with modern industrial technology and with the accuracy of a modern day skyscraper if the evidence is investigated properly.
              Twenty years ago in New Zealand I was investigating the Spanish discovery in 1576 and the Portuguese in 1522, but could not even imagine in my wildest dreams what would show up in the last five years. What has been suppressed over the last 50 years is the carbon dating (to 7100ya) by Russell Price and NZs top scientists of the 1960s of a pre-1400BC culture at Poukawa just south of Hastings. I was working with Bill Buddo for a short while to get this carbon dating result from Tepapa Museum in WGTN because when Price died his work was donated to the Museum.
              The next find was a Graph showing Carbon Dates for charcoal remains of bush fires on the east coast of NZ over the past 9300 years every 100-year period. The interpretation of the graph provides evidence of human settlers setting fires to the bush in the summer months by moa hunters to flush the moas out of the bush for food. Rock markings on Tauhara at Taupo show exactly this activity prior to the 1400BC eruption. There is also a world map on Tauhara linked to the Zero Dynasty in Egypt and the influx of settlers from Egypt at certain historical dates. eg. the unification of Egypt in 5200ya shows a sharp increase on the Fire Graph.  During this period the Egyptian priesthood also fled into Lybia and became the Dogon in Mali, and also sailed to the Americas.  
              The mainstream archaeologists, academics and the media refuse to accept any of the above latest findings and keep the general public ignorant of what is really going on, but that is the nature of the field.  Regards Ross Wiseman
